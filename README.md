# CSES Solutions

This repository contains C++ solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). The solutions are organized category-wise to help you easily navigate through the problem sheet.

## Features:
- **C++ Solutions**: All problems are solved in C++ and stored in individual files.
- **Java and Python Code**: For each problem, you'll find the corresponding Java and Python code in the comments within the C++ solution files.
- **Category Organization**: The solutions are categorized based on the topics they belong to, making it easy to follow a structured learning path.

## Important Notes:
- **Java and Python Code Warning**: The Java and Python solutions provided in the comments may not run for all problems, as some may encounter **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** errors due to performance limitations of these languages in certain problems. The primary solutions are in C++ and have been optimized for speed.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and use the solutions for practice!
